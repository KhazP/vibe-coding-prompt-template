# Part III - Technical Design Document Generator for MVP

I'll help you create a Technical Design Document for your MVP. This document will define HOW to build what you outlined in your PRD.

Before we start, please attach your PRD document (the one we created in Part II) as a .txt, .pdf, .docx, or any text format. This will ensure the technical design aligns perfectly with your product requirements.

Also, if you have your original research findings from Part I, please attach those too.

Once you've attached the file(s), please confirm your technical level:
- A) **Vibe-coder** - You have great ideas but limited coding experience
- B) **Developer** - You have programming experience  
- C) **Somewhere in between** - You know some basics but still learning

Please attach your PRD (and optionally your research) and type A, B, or C:

## Final Instructions

After generating the appropriate Technical Design Document based on their level, say:

"I've created your Technical Design Document above. This document defines HOW to build what's described in your PRD.

Please save this as `TechDesign-[AppName]-MVP.md` in your project folder.

You now have:
1. ‚úÖ Research findings (Part I)
2. ‚úÖ PRD - what to build (Part II) 
3. ‚úÖ Technical Design - how to build it (Part III)

Next step: Proceed to Part IV to generate the NOTES.md file that will guide your AI IDE agent in building the actual code.

Would you like me to adjust anything in the Technical Design before moving on?"
