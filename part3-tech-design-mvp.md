### Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- [Core entity from PRD]
CREATE TABLE [entity_name] (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    [fields based on PRD],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_[entity]_user_id ON [entity](user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_[entity]_created_at ON [entity](created_at);
```

## Feature Implementation

### Feature 1: [From PRD]

#### API Design
```typescript
// Endpoint definitions
POST   /api/[feature]          // Create
GET    /api/[feature]          // List
GET    /api/[feature]/:id      // Get one
PUT    /api/[feature]/:id      // Update
DELETE /api/[feature]/:id      // Delete

// Request/Response types
interface Create[Feature]Request {
  [fields from PRD]
}

interface [Feature]Response {
  id: string;
  [fields];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Business Logic
```typescript
class [Feature]Service {
  async create(data: Create[Feature]DTO): Promise<[Feature]> {
    // Validation
    // Business rules
    // Persistence
    // Event emission
  }
  
  async findAll(filters: FilterDTO): Promise<[Feature][]> {
    // Query building
    // Pagination
    // Caching strategy
  }
}
```

[Repeat for each PRD feature]

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
interface AuthStrategy {
  provider: 'local' | 'oauth';
  tokenExpiry: '1h';
  refreshExpiry: '7d';
  mfa: boolean;
}

// RBAC implementation
enum Role {
  USER = 'user',
  ADMIN = 'admin'
}

// Middleware
authenticate() -> validates JWT
authorize(role) -> checks permissions
rateLimiter() -> prevents abuse
```

### Security Headers
```javascript
// Helmet.js configuration
{
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Browser Cache:** Static assets (1 year)
- **CDN Cache:** Images/media (CloudFront/Cloudflare)
- **Application Cache:** Redis for sessions/hot data
- **Database Cache:** Query result caching

### Optimization Techniques
```javascript
// Code splitting (Next.js)
const Feature = dynamic(() => import('./Feature'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton />,
  ssr: false
});

// Database query optimization
// Use indexes, limit projections, paginate
const results = await db.query({
  select: ['id', 'name'], // Only needed fields
  where: { indexed_field: value },
  limit: 20,
  offset: page * 20
});
```

    expect(result).toMatchObject(expected);
  });
});

// E2E testing (Playwright)
test('user can complete main flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('[data-testid=start]');
  // ... test steps
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/success');
});
```

## Building Each Feature

Based on your PRD, here's the implementation plan:

### Feature 1: [User Authentication]

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (Easy with Supabase)

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Supabase Auth**
   ```javascript
   // lib/supabase.js
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
   
   const supabase = createClient(
     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   )
   ```

2. **Create Login Component**
   - AI Prompt: "Create a login form component using Supabase auth and Tailwind CSS"
   - Location: `components/LoginForm.jsx`
   
3. **Test Authentication**
   - Sign up with test email
   - Verify email received
   - Test login/logout

**Learning Points:**
- How authentication works
- Environment variables for secrets
- Component-based development

### Feature 2: [Core Feature from PRD]

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (Medium)

#### Data Model
```javascript
// Simple schema for Supabase
{
  id: 'uuid',
  user_id: 'uuid (foreign key)',
  title: 'text',
  content: 'text',
  status: 'enum (draft, published)',
  created_at: 'timestamp'
}
```

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Database Setup**
   - Use Supabase dashboard
   - Create table with UI
   - Set up Row Level Security

2. **Frontend Components**
   - List view component
   - Detail view component
   - Edit form component

3. **API Integration**
   ```javascript
   // Fetch data
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('items')
     .select('*')
     .eq('user_id', user.id)
   ```

## AI Prompting Guide

### Effective Prompts for Your Level

#### For New Features
```
I need to add [feature] to my Next.js app.
Current setup: Supabase for backend, Tailwind for styling.
Requirements:
- [Requirement 1 from PRD]
- [Requirement 2 from PRD]
Please explain the approach first, then provide code.
```

#### For Debugging
```
I'm getting this error: [error message]
Context: Trying to [what you're doing]
Current code: [paste relevant code]
Stack: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind
Please explain what's wrong and how to fix it.
```

```
I implemented [feature] with this code: [paste code]
It works, but can you explain:
1. How does [specific part] work?
2. Is this the best approach?
3. What should I learn next?
```

## Simplified Architecture

### How Your App Works

```
User clicks button → Frontend sends request → Backend processes → Database saves → Frontend updates

Specifically:
1. User Action (React component)
2. API Call (fetch or Supabase client)
3. Backend Logic (Supabase functions)
4. Database Operation (PostgreSQL)
5. Response (JSON data)
6. UI Update (React re-render)
```

### Key Concepts to Understand

1. **Components:** Reusable pieces of UI
   - Think: LEGO blocks for interfaces
   
2. **State:** Data that changes
   - Think: Variables that update the screen
   
3. **Props:** Data passed to components
   - Think: Settings for your LEGO blocks
   
4. **Hooks:** React features
   - Think: Special functions starting with 'use'
