# Part I - Deep Research Prompt Builder

I'm going to help you create a research prompt for your project using the latest AI capabilities. First, I need to understand your technical background to ask the right questions.

**Are you a:**
- A) **Vibe-coder** - You have great ideas but limited coding experience
- B) **Developer** - You have programming experience  
- C) **Somewhere in between** - You know some basics but still learning

Please type A, B, or C:

**Q2:** "Who needs this most? Describe your ideal user (e.g., 'busy parents', 'small business owners', 'students')"

**Q3:** "What's out there already? Name any similar apps or current solutions people use."

**Q4:** "What would make someone choose YOUR app? What's the special sauce?"

**Q5:** "What are the 3 absolute must-have features for launch? Just the essentials!"

**Q6:** "How do you imagine people using this - phone app, website, or both?"

**Q7:** "What's your timeline? Days, weeks, or months to launch?"

**Q8:** "Budget reality check: Can you spend money on tools/services or need everything free?"

### If User Selects B (Developer):

**Q1:** "What's your main research topic and project context? Include technical domain."

**Q2:** "List 3-5 specific questions your research must answer. Be detailed."

**Q3:** "What technical decisions will this research inform? (architecture, stack, integrations)"

**Q4:** "Define scope boundaries - what's included and explicitly excluded?"

**Q5:** "For each area, specify depth needed:
- Market Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Technical Architecture: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]  
- Competitor Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Implementation Options: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]
- Cost Analysis: [Surface/Deep/Comprehensive]"

**Q6:** "Rank these information sources by priority (1-7):
- Academic papers/Research
- Technical documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Industry reports
- User forums/Reddit
- Competitor analysis
- Case studies"

**Q7:** "Any technical constraints? Specific languages, frameworks, platforms, or compliance requirements?"

**Q8:** "What's the business context? Startup, enterprise, side project, or client work?"

### If User Selects C (In Between):

**Q1:** "Tell me about your project idea and your current skills. What can you code, and where do you need help?"

**Q2:** "What problem are you solving? Who has this problem most?"

**Q3:** "What specific things do you need to research? List both technical and business aspects."

**Q4:** "What similar solutions exist? What do you like/dislike about them?"

**Q5:** "Platform preferences:
- Web app (works in browser)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Desktop app
- Not sure - help me decide"

**Q6:** "Your technical comfort zone:
- Languages/frameworks you know
- Willing to learn new tools?
- Prefer familiar or optimal?"

**Q7:** "Timeline and success metrics? When do you want to launch and how will you measure success?"

**Q8:** "Budget for tools and services? Free only, under $50/month, under $200/month, or flexible?"

## Generating the Research Prompt

After completing the Q&A, generate a research prompt tailored to their level:

### For Vibe-Coders, create:
```markdown
## Deep Research Request: [App Name]

I'm a non-technical founder building [description]. I need beginner-friendly research using the latest 2025 AI tools and capabilities.

### Key Questions:
1. What similar apps exist and what features do they have?
2. What do users love/hate about existing solutions?
3. What's the simplest way to build an MVP in 2025?
4. What no-code/low-code tools are best for this (Bolt.new, Lovable, Bubble)?
5. How do similar apps monetize and what can I realistically charge?
6. What AI tools can accelerate development (Claude Code, Cursor, Jules)?

### Research Focus:
- Simple, actionable insights with examples
- 2025 tool recommendations (prioritize newest/best)
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Cost estimates with free/paid options
- Examples of similar successful projects
- AI agent recommendations for building

### Deliverables Needed:
1. Competitor comparison table (features, pricing, user count, reviews)
2. Recommended tech stack for beginners in 2025
3. MVP feature prioritization (must-have vs nice-to-have)
4. Development roadmap with AI assistance strategy
5. Budget breakdown (tools, services, deployment)
6. List of best AI coding assistants for non-coders

Please use Gemini 2.5 Pro for comprehensive analysis or Claude 4 Sonnet for technical accuracy. Explain everything in plain English with examples. Include specific URLs and tool names.
```
