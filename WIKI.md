# Vibe-Coding Workflow Wiki

## Overview
The Vibe-Coding Workflow is a systematic 4-part process for transforming app ideas into working MVPs using AI assistance. This workflow leverages the latest AI models and coding agents available in 2025 to accelerate development from concept to deployment.

## Workflow Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Time Required | Output |
|-------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Part I: Deep Research** | Validate market opportunity and technical feasibility | 20-30 minutes | Research findings document |
| **Part II: PRD Creation** | Define product requirements and scope | 15-20 minutes | Product Requirements Document |
| **Part III: Technical Design** | Plan architecture and tech stack | 15-20 minutes | Technical Design Document |
| **Part IV: AI Agent Instructions** | Generate coding instructions for AI agents | 5-10 minutes | NOTES.md (AGENTS.md in this repo) + tool configs |
| **Build Phase** | AI agent builds the MVP | 1-3 hours | Working application |

## User Levels Supported

The workflow adapts to three user experience levels:

- **A) Vibe-coder** - Limited coding experience, relies on AI for implementation
- **B) Developer** - Experienced programmer who codes with AI assistance  
- **C) In-between** - Basic coding knowledge, learning while building

## Key Features

- **Adaptive questioning** - Different question sets based on user experience level
- **Current AI model support** - Updated for 2025 AI tools and capabilities
- **Multiple AI agent support** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and others
- **Cost-aware recommendations** - Considers budget constraints in tool selection
- **Incremental approach** - Build and test one feature at a time

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Modern web browser
- 2-4 hours of available time
- Access to an AI platform (AI Studio, Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.)
- AI coding agent or IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.)

### Optional
- Node.js 18+ (for terminal-based agents)
- GitHub account (for version control)
- Basic understanding of web development concepts

## Success Metrics

Based on documented usage:
- **Average time to MVP**: 4 hours (compared to 4 weeks traditional development)
- **Workflow completion rate**: High adoption across different skill levels
- **Tool compatibility**: Supports 8+ different AI coding platforms

## Getting Started

1. Choose your AI platform and coding agent.
2. Start with **Part I: Deep Research** (`part1-deepresearch.md`).
3. Follow each part sequentially (`part2-prd-mvp.md`, `part3-tech-design-mvp.md`, `part4-notes-for-agent.md`).
4. Use generated files (research, PRD, Tech Design, NOTES/AGENTS + configs) to guide your AI agent.
5. Build and deploy your MVP.

## Documentation Structure

- **Part I: Deep Research** - Market validation and technical analysis
- **Part II: PRD Creation** - Product requirements definition
- **Part III: Technical Design** - Architecture planning
- **Part IV: AI Agent Instructions** - Coding instruction generation (NOTES.md / AGENTS.md + tool configs)
- **AI Tools Guide** - Comprehensive tool comparison
- **Quick Start Guide** - Step-by-step implementation
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
