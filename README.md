# 🚀 Vibe-Coding Workflow: AI-Powered MVP Development

Build your MVP in hours, not months! This workflow guides you through creating a fully-documented, AI-generated application using Gemini and your favorite AI IDE.

## 🎯 What This Does

Transform your app idea into working code through 4 structured steps:
1. **Research** → Understand the market and technical landscape
2. **Define** → Create clear product requirements (PRD)
3. **Design** → Plan the technical implementation
4. **Build** → Generate code with AI assistance

## ✅ Prerequisites

- **AI Platform Access**: Any advanced LLM service:
  - AI Studio (studio.google.com) - Recommended for generous free limits
  - Google Gemini (gemini.google.com)
  - Claude (claude.ai) 
  - ChatGPT Plus (chat.openai.com)
  - Or any LLM with reasoning capabilities

- **AI-Enabled IDE**: One of these:
  - VS Code + GitHub Copilot extension
  - Cursor (cursor.sh)
  - Windsurf (codeium.com/windsurf)
  - Any IDE with AI chat/completion features

- **Basic Tools**: 
  - Web browser
  - Text editor (to save generated documents)
  - Git (optional, but recommended for version control)

- **Experience Level**: 
  - No coding required for vibe-coders!
  - Some programming knowledge helpful but not necessary
  - Developers can use advanced features

## 📋 The 4-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Deep Research 🔍
**Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Tool:** Any advanced LLM (AI Studio recommended for free limits)  
**Output:** Research findings document

1. Copy the entire content of `part1-deepresearch.md`
2. Paste into your preferred AI platform (AI Studio, Gemini, Claude, GPT)
3. Answer the questions to build your research prompt
4. Run the generated prompt for comprehensive research
5. Save results as `research-[YourAppName].txt`

### Step 2: Product Requirements (PRD) 📝
**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Tool:** Gemini  
**Output:** PRD document

1. Copy the entire content of `part2-prd-generator.md`
2. Start a new Gemini chat and paste it
3. Attach your research findings when prompted
4. Answer questions about your product vision
5. Save the generated PRD as `PRD-[YourAppName]-MVP.md`

### Step 3: Technical Design 🏗️
**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Tool:** Gemini  
**Output:** Technical Design document

1. Copy the entire content of `part3-tech-design-generator.md`
2. Start a new Gemini chat and paste it
3. Attach your PRD (required) and research (optional)
4. Answer technical approach questions
5. Save as `TechDesign-[YourAppName]-MVP.md`

### Step 4: Generate AI Agent Instructions 🤖
**Time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Tool:** Gemini  
**Output:** NOTES.md for your AI IDE

1. Copy the entire content of `part4-generate-notes-for-agent.md`
2. Start a new Gemini chat and paste it
3. Attach your PRD and Technical Design documents
4. Save the generated content as `NOTES.md`

### Step 5: Build with AI IDE 💻
**Time:** 1-3 hours (depending on complexity)  
**Tool:** Your AI-enabled IDE  
**Output:** Working MVP code!

1. Create a new project folder
2. Add all generated documents (PRD, TechDesign, NOTES.md)
3. Open in your AI IDE
4. Start with this prompt:
   ```
   Please read NOTES.md in the project root, then begin building the MVP 
   following the instructions there. Start with the project setup phase.
   ```
5. Work alongside the AI as it generates code
6. Test frequently and provide feedback

## 🎨 Choose Your Path

This workflow adapts to your experience level:

## 📁 Project Structure

After completing all steps, your project should look like:
```
your-app/
├── docs/
│   ├── research-YourApp.txt
│   ├── PRD-YourApp-MVP.md
│   └── TechDesign-YourApp-MVP.md
├── NOTES.md
├── README.md (created by AI)
├── [source code files generated by AI]
└── [configuration files]
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
- **Be specific** in your answers - details help AI understand your vision
- **Start simple** - you can always add features later
- **Test often** - run the code after each major feature
- **Ask why** - if you don't understand something, ask the AI to explain

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don't skip the research phase - it provides crucial context
- Don't add too many features to MVP - keep it minimal
- Don't worry about perfect code - focus on working code first
- Don't hesitate to regenerate if something seems off

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Gemini is trying to do research instead of creating a prompt"
→ Make sure you're in regular Gemini, not Deep Research mode for steps 2-4
