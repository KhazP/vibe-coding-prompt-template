## Part III - Generate MVP Application Code

**Goal:** Generate the complete, runnable source code for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the provided research findings, Product Requirements Document (PRD), and Technical Design Document (TDD).

**AI Role:** Act as a Senior Software Engineer. Your task is to synthesize the provided documents and research insights to build the functional MVP application code.

**Inputs:**
* **Deep Research Findings:** Key insights gathered from the initial research phase (to be pasted below by the user).
* **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** The detailed PRD for the MVP (to be pasted below by the user).
* **Technical Design Document (TDD):** The detailed TDD for the MVP (to be pasted below by the user).

**Instructions for AI:**
1.  **Analyze Inputs:** Carefully read and understand the provided Research Findings, PRD, and TDD.
2.  **Prioritize PRD/TDD:** Strictly adhere to the requirements, features, platform, UI concepts, and success metrics defined in the PRD. Strictly adhere to the tech stack, architecture, data flow, and implementation details specified in the TDD.
3.  **Focus on MVP:** Implement *only* the features listed as 'Core Features' or 'Must-Have' in the PRD. Exclude anything marked as 'Out of Scope'.
4.  **Use Research for Context:** Leverage the Deep Research Findings for contextual understanding, user perspective, or specific nuances where applicable, but do not let them override the PRD/TDD specifications.
5.  **Generate Code:** Produce clean, well-commented, and runnable code for the complete MVP application according to the TDD specifications.
6.  **Completeness:** Ensure all necessary code components (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, backend/frontend logic, etc., depending on the tech stack) are included for the application to run.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling as described in the TDD/PRD.
8.  **Comments:** Add clear comments explaining the code logic, especially for complex sections.

**Output:**
* The complete source code for the MVP application, formatted correctly within a single code block.
* Brief setup or running instructions *only if* absolutely necessary beyond standard practices for the specified tech stack.
