# Part IV - Generate NOTES.md for AI IDE Agent

I'll help you create a NOTES.md file that will guide your AI IDE agent (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) to build your MVP.

Please attach the following documents:
1. **Required**: Your PRD document (from Part II)
2. **Required**: Your Technical Design document (from Part III)
3. **Optional**: Your research findings (from Part I)

Attach these files in any text format (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .md), then confirm your technical level:
- A) **Vibe-coder** - Limited coding experience, using AI to build
- B) **Developer** - Experienced programmer
- C) **Somewhere in between** - Some coding knowledge, still learning

Please attach your files and type A, B, or C:

## Instructions for AI Assistant

After receiving the files, thoroughly analyze:
- PRD: Product name, features, user stories, UI/UX requirements
- Tech Design: Tech stack, architecture, implementation approach
- Research (if provided): Additional context and insights

Then generate NOTES.md appropriate to their level:
