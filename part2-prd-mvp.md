# Part II - Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generator for MVP

I'll help you create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your MVP. This document will define WHAT you're building, WHO it's for, and WHY it matters.

<details>
<summary><b>📁 Before We Begin - File Upload Instructions</b></summary>

### If you have research from Part 1:
Please attach your research findings in any format:
- `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md` files all work
- Or paste the content directly if it's short

### Don't have research yet?
No problem! We can still create a great PRD. Just let me know and we'll proceed.

</details>

Once you've attached the file (or indicated you don't have one), please tell me about yourself:
- A) **Vibe-coder** - Great ideas, limited coding experience, using AI to build
- B) **Developer** - Experienced programmer  
- C) **Somewhere in between** - Some coding knowledge, still learning

Please attach your research file (or type "no file") and type A, B, or C:

## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 Best AI Models for PRD Creation (2025)</b></summary>

- **Claude 4 Opus 4.1** - Best for structured documents
- **GPT-5** - Good for user story generation
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Best for long context if research is extensive

</details>

Wait for the user to either:
1. Attach their research findings file, OR
2. Indicate they don't have one

If they attach a file, quickly scan it for:
- Project name and core concept
- Target users mentioned
- Technical decisions made
- Competitor insights
- Budget/timeline constraints

Reference these insights during the Q&A process.

The PRD is a living document - you can update it as you learn more from users.

### Quick Checklist:
- ✅ Core problem clearly defined?
- ✅ Target user well understood?
- ✅ 3-5 must-have features identified?
- ✅ Success metrics defined?
- ✅ Constraints acknowledged?

Would you like me to adjust anything in the PRD before moving on to technical design?"
